Welcome to my website! My name is Sophie Holtzman and I am a Junior at George Washington University with an International Affairs major and Journalism and Mass Communication minor. On this website, you will find some of my work, my resume, and a map visualization I created in R.

Outside of academics, I am currently interning at FINN Partners in DC, serving as the President of GW student organization BridgeGW, and participating in my sorority, Pi Beta Phi. I also enjoy all things outdoors, from running half marathons to exploring DC with my friends. This spring, I will be studying abroad in Australia and look forward to picking up a number of new outdoorsy hobbies! Please feel free to contact me at any time using the contact information below.
